      <li><strong>Therapeutic implants:</strong> Devices that treat depression, addiction, or anxiety by regulating brain signals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåç Human-Centered Design: Keeping Empathy at the Core</h2>
    <p>As developers and researchers race ahead, the guiding principle must always remain: <em>What makes us more human?</em> Every breakthrough in brain-tech must first ask: does this improve life? Does it respect dignity, consent, and individual freedom?</p>
    <p>From kids regaining control of their limbs to elderly patients finding new ways to communicate‚ÄîBCIs show the best of what tech can be: a bridge, not a barrier.</p>

    <h2>üí¨ Final Thought</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôre entering a future where our minds may no longer be limited by speech, movement, or even devices. But as we build this brave new world, let‚Äôs ensure it‚Äôs one built not just on innovation‚Äîbut on integrity, inclusivity, and compassion.</p>
    <p>The brain may be the interface, but the heart must always lead the way.</p>
