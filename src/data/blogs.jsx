      <h2>üöÄ The Future of AI & Robotics</h2>
      <p>In the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have moved from sci-fi fantasies to transformative realities...</p>
      
      <h3>ü§ñ Smarter Robots, Seamless Integration</h3>
      <p>Robots are no longer limited to factory floors. Powered by advanced AI, they are gaining the ability to see, hear, feel‚Äîand crucially‚Äîlearn.</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaborative robots (cobots)</strong> will work side-by-side with humans in manufacturing, healthcare, and even retail.</li>
        <li><strong>Home robotics</strong> will evolve from vacuum cleaners to fully integrated smart assistants handling everything from cooking to elderly care.</li>
        <li><strong>Swarm robotics</strong>, inspired by the collective behavior of insects, will handle tasks like search-and-rescue, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>üß† AI Is the Brain, Robotics the Body</h3>
      <p>AI algorithms are giving robots the ability to process vast data, recognize patterns, and make decisions in real time...</p>
  
      <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Questions and the Human Factor</h3>
      <p>As machines get smarter, the conversation around ethics and control grows louder...</p>
  
      <h3>üåç The Big Picture: A Collaborative Future</h3>
      <p>The goal isn't to replace humans, but to augment our capabilities...</p>
  
      <h2>‚ú® Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>The future of AI and robotics is not just about machines‚Äîit‚Äôs about <em>us</em>. The choices we make today will shape how these technologies evolve and integrate into our lives...</p>
